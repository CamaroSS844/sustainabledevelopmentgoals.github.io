        <h3> Calling all innovative and creative minds!!!</h3>

        <p> The Sustainable Development  but (SDGs) were adopted by all United Nations (UN) member 
        States in 2015, they provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.</p>
        
        <p> At the heart of the UN blue print are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
        which are urgent calls for action for all countries and the behest in developing global partnerships.
        They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go 
        hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, 
        and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.</p>
        
        <p> Most Zimbabweans and Africans don't know about the SDGs and need education, so they can be effective change agents.</p>
        
        <p> Ride Zimbabwe Campaign, Ride Africa Campaign , Racing for SDGs, Live Your Dream (LYD) and Great Africa Art Banner (GAAB)
        programs are activities which highlight the dreams, talents and visions of African young people and the means by which we
        will educate Zimbabwean and the continent about the SDGs.</p>
        
        <p> In developing these projects Afrika Speaks tapped into all aspects of life, physical expression, emotional engagement,
         intellectual expertise and the vibrant, radiant and exuberant spirit of Africa, especially the young people. </p>
        
        <p> Afrika Speaks believes that our continent and the world over, will be a better place to live in, 
        if we develop our communities in a way that nurtures human relationships, strengthens communications and create 
        bonds between people, nations and the environment. </p>
        
        
        <p> Afrika Speaks is going to ride 1300km around Zimbabwe in the month of September
         (#SDGsMonth) in partnership with UNDP Zimbabwe and other cooperating and developmental partners. </p>
        
        <p> The questions that requires your input are:
        How can we make sure that at least the average Zimbabwean
         will know about the SDGs during our 3 weeks campaign while we are passing
          through Zimbabwe's major cities and towns?</p>
        
        
        <p> The ride will have 17+55 different riders (unemployed graduates) with great dreams,
        visions and artistic gifts everyday riding 17+55 km. </p>
        
        <p> How can we also make sure the ride around Zimbabwe will be a must follow to
         African young people and world over on social media? </p>
        
        <p> The best 3 with creative and innovative solutions will be invited
        to be part of the project team,  marketing and communication programs. </p>
